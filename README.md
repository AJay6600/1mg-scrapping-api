# 🩺 Medicine Category Fetcher

This project fetches the **categories of medicines** from the [1mg](https://www.1mg.com/) website by taking an **Excel (.xlsx)** file containing a list of medicine names as input.

It reads the Excel file, processes each medicine, and retrieves its category data from 1mg. The results are displayed on the frontend and can be exported or saved as needed.
